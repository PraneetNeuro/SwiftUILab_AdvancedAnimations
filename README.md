# SwiftUILab_AdvancedAnimations

A port of SwiftUILab's Advanced Animations that also supports `macOS`

Here's the [Ghist of the original app](https://gist.github.com/swiftui-lab/e5901123101ffad6d39020cc7a810798)

I've refactored it a bit, to have each example in its own folder.
I've also made a category on `View` as from [this](https://newbedev.com/in-swiftui-is-it-possible-to-use-a-modifier-only-for-a-certain-os-target) blog post
